# 📊 Student Academic Performance Analysis

A data science project focused on analyzing and predicting student academic outcomes using real-world academic data.

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores factors affecting student performance through data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models.

## 📁 Dataset  
The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[Student Academic Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – for data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** – for data visualization and correlation analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** – for building and evaluating ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)

## 📈 Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw student data  
- Performed EDA to identify patterns and relationships in performance  
- Engineered meaningful features for model training  
- Trained and evaluated ML models to predict student performance  
- Visualized key academic insights and model results

## 📷 Sample Visualizations  
(Add your images here after uploading them to GitHub)

Example:

## 📌 Results  
- Random Forest model achieved approximately **XX% accuracy** *(replace with your actual result)*  
- Identified key features contributing to student success (e.g., test preparation, parental education level, etc.)
